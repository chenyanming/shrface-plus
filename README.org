* shrface-plus is NO LONGER SUPPORT

=shrface-plus= is originally an extension library for =shrface.el= and the project
target is for any non-org buffers. Apparently, It does not need =shr= to work, =shr=
is only for eww/nov.el/mu4e, so I change to a new name - =inherit-org=, for
chasing the project target: inherit org faces for any non-org buffers.

Please check[[https://github.com/chenyanming/inherit-org][ inherit-org]] instead.

* Prerequisites
This module requires =shrface.el=

* Before the installation
This package would not give you 100% org features to non-org buffers, but it can
give you a more nature/similar interface just like org mode. Some major modes
can support more org features, some can not, because different packages have
different design, hacking all non-org library is difficult and a long way to go.

Anyway, please go ahead~
